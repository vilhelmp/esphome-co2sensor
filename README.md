# # CO2 sensor

Files and how-to for making a CO2 sensor using the Sensirion SCD30 and a ESP 8266 (D1 Mini type)

## Introduction

This document describes how I built a CO2 sensor that integrates into [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/){:target="_blank} in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/){:target="_blank"}. The build is using a ESP 8266 board, the Wemos D1 mini. If you have Victoria Metrics and Grafana or equivalent in you Home Assistant you can also gain long term insights from this sensor.

Above is an example of a 7 day series, shown in Grafana with officially bad, ok and good levels. The current location of the sensor is perhaps not ideal, but the measurements have a consistent periodicity. 

## Materials

- Wemos D1 mini (or equivalent)  
- Sensirion SCD 30  
- Experiment board  
- Fitting case for experiment board  
- Display (I used the 0.96 inch SSD1306 display)  
- Cables and pins  

## Steps

1. Buy the material.

2. Integrate the main board (D1 mini) into ESPHome

3. Solder the pins to the boards.

4. Solder the boards to the exerpiment card.

5. Cut the wires in the right length and prepare to be soldered.

6. Solder the wires.

7. Flash the board through ESPHome with the code.

8. Voila! Your own CO2 sensor.

## Wiring

The wiring is pretty straight forward, I made a diagram to clarify it.

## Code

To get the device up and running you need to first make the initial flash of the ESP8266 board. Just plug the USB into the device running ESPHome/Home Assistant and flash it. After this you edit the ESPHome code and flash it remotely.

Here is the code:

```yml
esphome:
 name: esp-co2
 friendly_name: esp-co2

esp8266:
 board: d1_mini

# Enable Home Assistant API

 # Enable fallback hotspot (captive portal) in case wifi connection fails

     // Print time in HH:MM format
     it.strftime(32, 0, id(font2), TextAlign::TOP_CENTER, "%H:%M", id(esptime).now());

     // Print inside temperature (from homeassistant sensor)
     if (id(espco2_temp).has_state()) {
       it.printf(50, 30, id(font3), TextAlign::BASELINE_RIGHT , "%.1f°", id(espco2_temp).state);
     }

     // Print inside temperature (from homeassistant sensor)
     if (id(espco2_humidity).has_state()) {
       it.printf(55, 30, id(font3), TextAlign::BASELINE_LEFT , "%.1f pct", id(espco2_humidity).state);
     }
     // Print inside temperature (from homeassistant sensor)
     if (id(espco2_co2).has_state()) {
       it.printf(30, 45, id(font3), TextAlign::BASELINE_LEFT , "%.1f ppm", id(espco2_co2).state);
     }
```

You might see log entry with ```Component display took a long time for an operation``` and ```Component should block for at most 20-30ms```. This is not strange, and the log message can be suppressed by adding this to the code

```yml
logger:
  level: DEBUG
  logs:
    component: ERROR
```



## Results

The device has been running now for over a year, and everything works as expected. Of course the measurements are mainly useful in relative terms, i.e. have the CO2 level gone up or down? Not, "the CO2 level is now exactly XXX ppm".
